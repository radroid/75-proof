# 75 Proof

> Free, privacy-first web app for tracking the 75 HARD mental toughness challenge.

75 Proof is a free companion app that helps people complete the 75 HARD challenge created by Andy Frisella. It tracks every daily requirement in one place so users can focus on doing the work instead of juggling spreadsheets and notes apps.

## What is 75 HARD?

75 HARD is a 75-day mental toughness program. Every day, participants must complete all six tasks — no exceptions, no substitutions. Missing any single task resets the counter to Day 0.

### The six daily requirements

1. **Two 45-minute workouts** — one must be outdoors
2. **Follow a diet** — any structured diet, no alcohol, no cheat meals
3. **Drink 1 gallon (128 oz) of water**
4. **Read 10 pages** of a non-fiction or self-improvement book (no audiobooks)
5. **Take a progress photo**
6. **No missed tasks** — miss one, restart from Day 0
